# Time-Series-And-Anomaly-Detection
In this repository, I have used ARIMA,SARIMA,AutoArima,ANN,CNN and LSTMs for time series modelling and Anomaly detection has been done using LSTM+Autoencoders.

### About Dataset 
In this repository I have used 2 different datasets, one of johnson and john stock prices for anomaly detection and second ofUS Airline Passengers for time series analysis
from Kaggle.The dataset has been imported from Kaggle with the following link:-
